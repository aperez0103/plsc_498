When working through this problem set, I initially cloned the course repository directly rather than forking it beforhand, resulting in an error when attempting to commit. Once I figured out my error, I was able to correct the mistake and finish everything. I would say that the actual cloning through RStudio was the least intuitive step for me, as I am used to interacting directly with github and my file manager.
